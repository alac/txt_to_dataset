    "story": "The rain fell in sheets, obscuring everything in sight. The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windows and shaking the trees. Inside, a young woman sat by the fire, reading a book. She shivered as the cold seeped through the windowpanes. The fire crackled and popped, sending sparks up the chimney. The woman could smell the woodsmoke, and it reminded her of camping trips with her family when she was a child. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, savoring the memory.\nSuddenly, there was a loud crash of thunder, and the lights went out. The woman jumped in surprise and the book fell from her hands. She sat in the darkness, listening to the storm rage outside. With her eyes closed, it felt like she could sense every raindrop as it fell.\nAfter a few minutes, she got up and went to the window causing the floorboards beneath her to creak; the sound was much more reasssuring than the rain, she thought. She pushed the window open and looked out; she could see nothing but darkness. The rain was still coming down, but the wind felt much more mild than she'd expected.\nThe woman sighed and turned away from the window. She went back toward the light of the fireplace and sat down. She concentrated on the warmth of the fire and tried to convince herself she was safe here. She grabbed a heavy volume off the table and opened it to where she'd left off, but she couldn't concentrate."
