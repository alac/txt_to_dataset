>Story: The car skidded to a stop, throwing Harry against the door. He braced himself against the dashboard as the tires spun, trying to find purchase on the icy road. The snow was coming down heavily now, obscuring his vision. He could barely see the other car, a dark blur in the distance.
The other car was gaining on him. Harry could see the headlights getting closer. He knew he had to do something, or he would be run off the road. He reached for the gearshift, but his hands were shaking too much. He couldn't get a grip.
The other car was right behind him now. Harry could see the driver's face, twisted with rage. He knew he was going to kill him.
Harry closed his eyes and braced himself for impact. But then, at the last second, the other car swerved around him and disappeared into the night.
Harry opened his eyes and took a deep breath. He had escaped, but he knew he wasn't safe yet. The other driver would be back.
