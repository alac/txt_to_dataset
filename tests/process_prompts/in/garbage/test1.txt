She stepped out into the narrow, muddy street, feeling her boots sink into the puddles as she made her way toward the main road. In the distance, she spotted two ragged men heading her way, their torn clothes filthy and reeking. One held a heavy wooden club that thudded menacingly with each step, while the other brandished a rusted knife, already stained with flecks of dried blood.
Liz felt her chest tighten, her hand drifting toward her own concealed blade as the men approached. Their sunken eyes raked over her greedily, seeing a victim rather than a fellow human being. She stood firm, glaring back at them.
"P-Please, miss..." The taller one stammered, clutching his club with filthy, trembling hands. "It's been a hard month, and we haven't eaten in days...P-Please, give us all you have, and we'll leave you alone."
Liz studied him closely. Behind the desperate pleading in his voice, she sensed the cruel excitement of a predator cornering his prey. His lanky companion flashed a grin, revealing a mouth of rotten, jagged teeth. He flipped his knife casually in his bony fingers.
Liz felt her anger rising, but she kept her face neutral. She loosened her cloak and placed a hand on her hip, allowing them to glimpse the sword at her belt.
"You want to rob me?" she asked calmly, eyes flicking between the two. She shifted her weight to the balls of her feet, ready to draw her blade.
The tall one licked his lips nervously. "I-I said please!" His eyes kept darting down to her sword. The other man took a small step back, his grinning fading.
Liz waited, muscles coiled. A long moment passed as the men hesitated, intimidated by the prospect of armed resistance. Finally, the tall one jerked his head and muttered a curse. They both turned and slunk back into the shadows without another word.
